# Finding Top 10 Subway Stations for Bilboard Marketing Campaign

> Kyle Turner

## Abstract
The goal of my project was to give my client 'California Sober' a model of the top 10 NYC subway stations for ridership in Manhattan + Brooklyn. With the data that I provide they would then be able to create a bilborad marketing campaign for their new THC Infused Seltzer at each station.
I worked with data from the [MTA Turnstile Data](http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html). After some exploritory analysis I was able to refine a model that I could use visualize my findings.

## Design
My prediction for the analysis was that the peak travel time for most stations would be 4pm - 8pm (for the weekdays), when people are getting off work. This is an ideal timeframe to market a THC Infused Seltzer.
The weekends were dropped because I wanted to focuse on the work crowd; people who would see the bilboards repeatdly.
