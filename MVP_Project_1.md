The goal of my project is to give California Sober a model of the top 10 stations for impressions per 4hrs based off the riders entering and exiting said stations durring peak travel time.

To start I found the top 10 stations for overall traffic then found the top days of the week for ridership, excluding weekends.

The results show the top 10 stations are all in Manhattan and Brooklyn, which I wanted, and the top day for riders is Friday.

I still need to plot the traffic means for each top 10 station based on the 4hr time interval. I may break down the time interval to 1hr sections.
